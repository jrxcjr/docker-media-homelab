# docker-media-homelab
This is a repo that houses the dockerfile for setting up the media setup in my homelab.

The services that are contained in the dockerfile allow you to setup a media server that downloads torrents via indexers that are setup in sonarr/radarr (that organize the files and tracks the media downloads).

To see the files that were downloaded in sonarr/radarr, you need to setup the Jellyfin server.
